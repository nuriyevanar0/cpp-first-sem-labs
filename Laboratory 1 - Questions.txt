Ex. 1
Write a program to prompt user to input her/his name and print his name with Hello on the screen.
e.g. Hello Urszula!

Ex. 2
Write a program to simulate chatting with user. Invent your sentences. 
e.g.
output: Hello. What is your name?
input: Anar.
output: Hello Anar. How are you?
input: Thanks I'm fine.
etc.

Ex. 3
Write a C++ program to generate initials of your name
e.g.

**  **  
**  **
******
**  **
**  **

Ex. 4
Write a C++ program that reads from user two numbers and calculates and prints results from various operations. Use all arithmetic operators.
Hint. In some operations we get floating point variable therefore we must cast integer values to the same floating point type as result variable.
e. g.
	int z=3;
	float result;
	result = 2 / (float)z;

Ex. 5
Write a C++ program that reads from user 3 integer values and print these values in forward and reversed order.
e.g.
4
2
3

3
2
4

Ex. 6
Write a program to prompt user to input a letter and print these letter on the screen with sentence:
" You wrote a letter ..."
e.g
input: a
output: You wrote a letter a


Ex.7
Write a program to prompt user to input temperature in Celcius scale and calculate it to Farenheit scale.

Ex.8
Write a program to prompt user to input temperature in Farenheit scale and calculate it to Farenheit scale Celcius scale.

Ex.9
Write a program that reads from user three numbers and calculates mean.

Ex. 10
Write a program that reads from user angle in degrees and converts it to radian.

Ex. 11
Write a program that reads from user angle in radian and converts it to degrees.

Ex. 12
Write a program to prompt user to input V as voltage, I as electric current and calculates the electrical resistance R with formula:
R=V/I

Ex. 13
Write a program which converts currency. Chose currency and find exchange rate.

Ex. 14
Write a program to prompt user to input a value stored in variable a. Calculate ++a, a++, --a, a-- but before each calculation restore variable a to user's value.

Ex. 15
Write a program that reads from user two points in cartesian coordinates and finds midpoint between them.

Ex. 16
Write a program that calculates kinetic energy from rigid bodies. Use formula: Ek=(p^2)/2m where Ek is kinetic energy, p is momentum, m is mass of the body. Read variables from user.

Ex. 17.
Write a flowchart for boiling water for a tea.

Ex. 18
Write a flowchart for determination whether a temperature is below or above the freezing point (0 in Celcius scale, 32 in Farenhait scale).
